# Weather API Project (WIP)

This project is from my Udacity course on Python and using Web APIs. I am committing my excercises in this repository and adding changes to the code which was corrected during the course. Most of the code will resemble what was walked through in that assignment.

## What is this project for?

This project aims to showcase how I am able to retrieve data from a weather website API. A list of public APIs can be found in `https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis`. 

I am using MetaWeather webiste as the source of the weather predictions.
